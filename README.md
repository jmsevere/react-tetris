# react-tetris

IN PROGRESS --- INCOMPLETE

A modern React implementation of the classic Tetris game.

I thought of doing this project for fun while watching the 2023 Tetris movie on Apple TV+
The game by Alexey Pajitnov is a classic and I wanted to recreate it.
React would not be my first choice for a game, but I wanted to give it a try. I have tried it in other languages. This is just a learning exercise to see how well I can do with React/Typescript.
